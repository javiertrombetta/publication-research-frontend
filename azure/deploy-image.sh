# Points the container app at the image built from the commit you are standing on, and nothing else.
#
# This exists because the deployment credential GitHub Actions would need cannot be created on the
# AIS tenant: registering an application is a directory permission ordinary accounts are not given,
# so the deploy job in the workflow skips itself and the last step stays manual. Everything up to
# that point is automatic, and this is the one command that finishes it.
#
# Nothing here touches configuration. Connection strings, secrets and environment variables were set
# by azure/deploy.sh and are left exactly as they are; only the image changes, which is the whole
# difference between this and a redeployment.
#
# Usage:
#   az login                  # once
#   ./azure/deploy-image.sh   # after CI has published the image for this commit
#
#   ./azure/deploy-image.sh sha-abc1234   # or name a tag yourself
